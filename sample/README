Sample files used to scaffold the development of the gdiff view code

So as to not have to worry about the back end details while developing the view
code this is a simple sample that will be used to populate the model and feed it
to the view:

  sample.diff - the output of a "git diff" invocation
  sample.from - the blob corresponding to the "from" file
  sample.to   - the blob corresponding to the "to" file

This is a simple diff which contains only one file. I'll later work on handling
multiple files.

Gdiff will expect these files to be present in the ~/tmp/ directory at runtime.
